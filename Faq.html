        <h3>What are THC-A Flowers?</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>All (THC dominant) Cannabis is naturally high in THC-A. THC-A is the acidic precursor to THC Delta-9 and
          naturally forms before Delta-9 during the lifecycle of the cannabis plant. THC-A also converts to THC Delta-9
          through Decarboxylation or heat.</p>

        <h3>What is Decarboxylation?</h3>
        <span><i class="bi bi-plus-lg"></i></span>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Decarboxylation is a chemical process that occurs when cannabis is heated, either by smoking, vaporizing, or
          baking. This process converts non-psychoactive cannabinoids, such as THC-A (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid), into
          psychoactive cannabinoids, such as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). In the case of marijuana, THC-A is the acidic
          precursor to THC. THC-A does not have psychoactive effects on its own. Still, when exposed to heat through
          decarboxylation, it loses a carboxyl group (COOH) and becomes THC, the psychoactive compound responsible for
          the "high" associated with marijuana consumption. Decarboxylation typically occurs when cannabis is heated to
          a certain temperature, usually around 220째F to 240째F (104째C to 115째C), for a specific amount of time. This
          process activates the cannabinoids present in the plant material, making them available for absorption by the
          body when consumed.In summary, decarboxylation is essential for unlocking the full potential of marijuana's
          psychoactive effects by converting THC-A into THC Delta-9 through the application of heat.</p>

        <h3>Do THC-A Flowers get you high?</h3>
        <span><i class="bi bi-plus-lg"></i></span>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, through the process of decarboxylation, THCA can convert into THC Delta-9, which is psychoactive.
          Therefore, after undergoing decarboxylation, THC-A flowers will produce euphoric effects when combusted
          (smoked).</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>What is the Decarboxylation Rate?</h3>
        <span><i class="bi bi-plus-lg"></i></span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Decarboxylation rate refers to the efficiency at which THC-A (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) converts into THC
          (tetrahydrocannabinol) Delta-9, a psychoactive compound, under specific conditions such as heat. The formula
          to calculate the amount of THC Delta-9 produced from THC-A during decarboxylation is:

          Total Potential THC = THC Delta-9 + THC-A in percentage (Conversion Rate)

          Given that the conversion rate is 0.877, let's use an example where we have a flower containing 30% THC-A:

          Total Potential THC = .2 + 30% (0.877)

          Total Potential THC = 26.51%

          So, when the flower containing 30% THC-A undergoes decarboxylation with a conversion rate of 0.877, it would
          produce approximately 26.31% THC Delta-9.
